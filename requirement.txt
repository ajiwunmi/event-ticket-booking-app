= SPEC-1: Event Ticket Booking System  
:sectnums:  
:toc:  

== Background  

Event management platforms require robust and scalable systems to handle ticket sales 
for concerts,
conferences, and other events. Users demand a fast and reliable way to book tickets 
concurrently, often leading to spikes in traffic when tickets are initially released.
Given the high likelihood of events selling out, a waiting list system ensures that 
users can still express interest and possibly receive tickets due to cancellations.  

This project aims to design a Node.js-based RESTful API for handling event ticket bookings, 
cancellations, and waiting list management.  

== Requirements  

Below are the system requirements categorized using the MoSCoW prioritization technique:  

=== Must Have  

- Initialize an event with a set number of available tickets.  
- Allow users to book tickets concurrently, ensuring ticket integrity and preventing 
overbooking.  
- Maintain a waiting list for when tickets are sold out.  
- Provide RESTful endpoints for the following functionalities:  
  - Viewing available tickets  
  - Viewing the waiting list  
  - Booking tickets  
  - Canceling tickets  
- Handle ticket cancellations and automatically assign canceled tickets to waiting 
list users in a fair manner (FIFO).
- Save order details (including ticket status and user information) to a relational 
database (RDBMS).  

=== Should Have  

- Basic input validation for ticket booking (e.g., checking available ticket count).  
- Graceful failure handling for overbooked or canceled requests.  

=== Could Have  

- Logging and monitoring for API request patterns and booking activities.  
- Secure APIs with token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).  

=== Won't Have  

- Payment processing or complex user authentication at this stage.
